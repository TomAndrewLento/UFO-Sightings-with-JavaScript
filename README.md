# UFO-Sightings-with-JavaScript
# Overview
* Create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

# Results
The data is on the right, and the filters are on the left.  The each filter matches the user's text entry to its corresponding column to check for a precise match.

# Summary 
* The biggest drawback is that the dataset is small

1) Filtering by whether corresponding data entries <i>have</i> text from the filters, rather than only a precise string match
2) The ability to click column names to order the data by ascending or descending attributes
3) The ability to search through comments for keywords and phrases
